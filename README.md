# pathviz

The goal of this project is to serve as a hub for concrete implementations and intuitive visualizations of classic algorithms related to path planning. The algorithms implemented here have been covered thoroughly in literature, as well as in various motion / path planning courses whose material is freely available online. In particular, ***Principles of Robot Motion (Choset, et al)*** and ***Computational Geometry (de Berg, et al)*** are respected books which served as my primary reference.
